# Zig Sandbox (zsandbox)

Zig Sandbox, or zsandbox, is a personal testing ground for exploring the capabilities and syntax of the Zig programming language. This repository contains code examples adapted from [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/), serving as practical exercises to familiarize oneself with Zig's features and conventions.

## Minimum Zig Version

To ensure compatibility with the provided code examples, it is recommended to use Zig version 0.11 or newer.

## Getting Started

To start experimenting with Zig in this sandbox, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tonytins/zsandbox.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository**:

   ```bash
   cd zsandbox
   ```

3. **Run the Examples**: Execute the code examples using the Zig compiler. For instance:

   ```bash
   zig build run
   ```

4. **Experiment and Learn**: Modify the code, try out different constructs, and see how Zig behaves.
